# PKULawGraduateThesisCitation
Developing a CSL according to Peking Universtiy Law School's requirements on graduate thesis English citation.

The PKU Graduate Thesis Citation style (hereinafter "the Style") is developed according to the citation style specified by Peking University Law School for English references in graduate thesis. For PKU Law School's citation requirements, see https://www.law.pku.edu.cn/jx/byyxw/wjgdbyyxw/30542.htm.

I used Oxford Art Journal as the template. For the Oxford Art Journal style, see https://www.zotero.org/styles/oxford-art-journal.

**What it supports**
The Style at present supports citations to books, journal articles, and webpages. It also supports citations to working papers, for which I exercised discretion on the format as PKU Law School has no specified format for this type of references.

The Style at present supports only footnotes but not Bibliography. Users may consider extracting bibliography entries manually from citation tools like Zotero and copy-paste them into the theses. For how to download and use Zotero, see https://www.zotero.org/.

The Style supports only citations to English sources.

**How it works**
The Style can be used in MS Word via Zotero plugins. For how to download Zotero, add styles, download plugins, and generate citations, see https://www.zotero.org/.

**Disclaimer**
The Style is developed solely for non-commercial use. It is subject to and welcomes changes from other contributors.

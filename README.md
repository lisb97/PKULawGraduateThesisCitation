# PKULawGraduateThesisCitation

The PKU Graduate Thesis Citation style (hereinafter "the Style") is developed according to the citation style specified by Peking University Law School for English references in graduate thesis. For PKU Law School's citation requirements, see https://www.law.pku.edu.cn/jx/byyxw/wjgdbyyxw/30542.htm.

I used Oxford Art Journal as the template. For the Oxford Art Journal style, see https://www.zotero.org/styles/oxford-art-journal.

**What it supports**

The Style at present supports citations to books, journal articles, and webpages. It also supports citations to book chapters and working papers, for which I exercised discretion on the formats as PKU Law School has no specified formats for these types of references.

The Style at present supports only footnotes but not Bibliography. Users may consider extracting bibliography entries manually from citation tools like Zotero and copy-paste them into the theses. For how to download and use Zotero, see https://www.zotero.org/.

The Style supports only citations to English sources.

**How it works**

The Style can be used in MS Word via Zotero plugins. For how to download Zotero, add styles, download plugins, and generate citations, see https://www.zotero.org/.

**Disclaimer**

The Style is developed for non-commercial and educational purposes. Users may use the Style only, and solely for their own personal, non-commercial use. The Style is subject to, and welcomes, modifications and developments from other contributors, provided that the modifications and developments do not cause change to the nature of the Style as an non-commercial, personal-use-only tool.

I shall not be legally responsible for the acts or omissions of any users and/or contributors, and shall also not be subject to any legal process, and/or shall bear no liabilities of any kind, be they financial or otherwise.
